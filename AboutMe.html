      <h2>Strengths (and weaknesses)</h2>
        <p>I have always had more of a technical mind. When it comes to subjects that involve solving problems, I have few difficulties in excelling. My creativity has always been weaker than my ability
        to solve problems. Throughout the years however I have worked to improve imagining things before putting them into practice.  </p>
